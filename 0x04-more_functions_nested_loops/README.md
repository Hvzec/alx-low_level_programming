## 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

This project contains the solutions to the tasks assigned in the "0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops" project at ALX. The tasks are designed to help understand and implement more functions and nested loops in C programming language.

### General Information
* Environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc
* Programming Language: C
* Style: Betty (betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl)

### Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* Files should be compiled using gcc with the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All the files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* The code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The prototypes of all functions should be included in the header file called `main.h`
* The code must be original, that is, you cannot use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
* The main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account

### Project Tasks

#### Task 0: isupper
* File: 0-isupper.c
* Function that checks for uppercase character
* Prototype: `int _isupper(int c);`
* Returns 1 if c is uppercase, 0 otherwise

#### Task 1: isdigit
* File: 1-isdigit.c
* Function that checks for a digit (0 through 9)
* Prototype: `int _isdigit(int c);`
* Returns 1 if c is a digit, 0 otherwise

#### Task 2: Collaboration is multiplication
* File: 2-mul.c
* Function that multiplies two integers
* Prototype: `int mul(int a, int b);`

#### Task 3: The numbers speak for themselves
* File: 3-print_numbers.c
* Function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, followed by a new line
* Prototype: `void print_numbers(void);`

#### Task 4: I believe in numbers and signs
* File: 4-print_most_numbers.c
* Function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, followed by a new line
* Do not print 2 and 4
* Prototype: `void print_most_numbers(void);`

#### Task 5: Numbers constitute the only universal language
* File: 5-more_numbers.c
* Function that prints 10 times the numbers from 0 to 14, followed by a new line
* Prototype: `void more_numbers(void);`

#### Task 6: The shortest distance between two points is a straight line
* File: 6-print_line.c
* Function that draws a straight line in the terminal
* Prototype: `void print_line(int n);`
* Where n is the number of times the character _ should be printed

#### Task 7: I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe
* File: 7-print_diagonal.c
* Function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal
